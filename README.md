# Bike Index

### By _**Marika Allely and Jon Nardine**_

## Description

####This app was built as an exercise for Epicodus and is not meant to be replicated. I'm keeping it here for my own records, and for nostalgia's sake. Feel free to play with it, but be aware that it is not a complete project.

Bike index allows a user to input a location in the form of a city name and state, a bike color, and a search radius.  The program returns a list of bikes (in order of most recent date) matching the description using the Bike Index API.

There's also a page for the weather because why not.
